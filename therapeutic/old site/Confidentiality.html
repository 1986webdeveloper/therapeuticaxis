					<p>The  information on this page explains our privacy policies in two areas:</p>
					
			        <ul>
			          <li><a href="http://www.therapeuticaxis.com/privacy.htm#Privacy_and_confidentiality_protocol">Confidentiality with respect to the  services we offer</a> &nbsp;and <a href="http://www.therapeuticaxis.com/privacy.htm#Website_Privacy">Privacy with respect to our website</a>, </li>
		          </ul>
			        <p><em>The  following points summarise the privacy and confidentiality procedures that will  be followed by your therapist and the administration staff at Therapeutic Axis.  These procedures are required by privacy and personal information legislation. </em></p>
			        <p>The  nature and content of your discussions with your therapist, as well as the fact  that you are a client of a therapist practicing at Therapeutic Axis, is  confidential.<br>
			          Your  therapist can only speak to someone else about you, or let somebody else know  that you are a client here, if they have your written permission. There are  some exceptions to this, as follows. </p>
			        <ul>
			          <li>Some  persons are required by law to report information regarding the ongoing abuse  of a child to the appropriate authorities. In addition, previous abuse of a  person who is not yet 16 years of age may need to be reported, even though the  abuse may have ceased. You should discuss with your therapist his or her  position on this before disclosing any such information. </li>
			          <li>If  your therapist has reason to believe that you may be in danger of killing or  doing serious physical harm to yourself or somebody else, then other people  (such as family members, emergency services or friends) may need to be advised,  in order to protect you or others. </li>
			          <li>If  legal proceedings are taken out against Therapeutic Axis or yourself relating  to your situation, then your therapist and/or your file may be subpoenaed by a  court of law. Should this occur you would be informed. </li>
			          <li>In  general, there is not a legal requirement for a therapist to report unsolved  crimes to the authorities. However, some therapists may feel a moral obligation  to report serious unsolved crimes of which they become aware (such as, for  example, murder). You should discuss with your therapist his or her position on  this before disclosing information about any crimes you may have committed but  have not been prosecuted for. </li>
			          <li>&nbsp;Therapists  may consult with each other within Therapeutic Axis for the purposes of  supervision, case consultation or debriefing. Should you have any personal or  family relationship with any other staff member, please advise your therapist.  Should this be the situation your case would not be discussed with that person. </li>
			          <li>In  order to comply with professional and ethical requirements, all Therapeutic  Axis counsellors are required to undertake regular clinical supervision with a  suitable professional. This is to protect you&mdash;to help ensure your counsellor&rsquo;s  objectivity and clarity, and to ensure that the counsellor&rsquo;s personal issues do  not impinge on your case. On such occasions, identifying details will not be  disclosed. </li>
		          </ul>
			        <h3>Storage and Use of Information </h3>
			        <p><em>Intake  Information</em><br>
			          Your  intake information is confidential and accessed by your therapist and  administration only. Non-identifiable summary information of all clients may,  from time to time, be used for statistical and demographic purposes by  Therapeutic Axis.<br>
  <em>Storage  of Client Files</em><br>
			          Your  file will be stored in a locked filing cabinet and can only be accessed by your  own therapist. Only in the case of an emergency will another person have access  to details that may be contained in your file. These records are required to be  kept for five years, after which they must be destroyed.</p>
			        <h3>Your Access to Information about You </h3>
			        <p>You  are entitled to see the information that is kept about you. You also have a right  to a copy of that material, and to make corrections to information that you can  demonstrate is wrong. If we disagree about the content of information, the  original may be kept, but a statement by you indicating your version of the  point of disagreement will be permanently attached. We require notice a week  before you need access to your file.<br>
			          Therapeutic  Axis and your therapist have the right to deny access to some of the material  in your file, if it may pose a serious threat to the life or health of yourself  or another person, or have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other  people.<br>
			          If you would like further information or you have any  concerns about our management of personal information; or you would like  access, in accordance with the National Privacy Principles, to any personal  information that we may have collected about you, please contact The Privacy  Officer.<br>
